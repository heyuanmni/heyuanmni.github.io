<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student at MIT co-advised by [Bryan Bryson](https://www.brysonlab.org) and [Paul Blainey](http://blainey.mit.edu). Trained as a molecular biologist 🧬, microbiologist 🦠, immunologist 🧫, and artificial‑intelligence scientist 🤖, I focus on using AI and high-throughput experiments to study functional genomics at the host–microbe co‑evolutionary interface. My specific aims are:

1. **At the molecular level, develop novel molecular tools and tricks** to unlock the hidden dimensions of molecular biology.
2. **At the systems level, leverage computer vision and high‑content screening** to explore uncharted aspects of cell biology.
3. **At the interorganismal level, use AI and biochemistry to model** the molecular evolutionary dynamics of bacteria and viruses.
