<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student at MIT co-advised by [Bryan Bryson](http://brysonlab.mit.edu) and [Paul Blainey](http://blainey.mit.edu). Trained as a molecular biologist üß¨, microbiologist ü¶†, immunologist üß´, and artificial‚Äëintelligence scientist ü§ñ, I focus on using AI and optical biology to study functional genomics and metagenomics at the host‚Äìmicrobe co‚Äëevolutionary interface. I use high‚Äëthroughput experimentation, novel molecular tools, and AI to illuminate the ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù of biology, namely the following:

1. **Use AI and biochemistry to study bacterial and viral evolutionary dynamics** under host immune pressure and to mine novel biological systems from metagenomic data.
2. **Develop novel molecular tools and tricks** to unlock the hidden dimensions of biology, such as *in vivo* host cell perturbation effects in bacterial pathogenesis.
3. **Leverage computer vision and high‚Äëcontent optical screening** to explore uncharted aspects of cell biology and uncover novel mechanisms of pathogen sensing and control.
