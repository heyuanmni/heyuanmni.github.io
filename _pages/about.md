<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student in the Biological Engineering Department at MIT.

I graduated *Summa Cum Laude* from UC Berkeley in May 2024, with Bachelor of Arts degrees in Molecular and Cell Biology and Data Science, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration.

Financial markets often fail to address important issues when they lack funding incentives. We see this, for example, in the underfunding of novel antibiotic discovery and tuberculosis vaccine development, despite the need. My research seeks to address these problems at large, using basic scientific advances to change our assumptions and create viable financing models for underserved indications.

From here, I am broadly interested in two areas of research: (i) exploring molecular co-evolution between organisms and natural systems to guide cost-effective vaccine development, and (ii) understanding immunological aging to advance pan-immune rejuvenation strategies.
