<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student in the Biological Engineering Department at MIT.

I graduated *Summa Cum Laude* from UC Berkeley, in May 2024, with Bachelor of Arts degrees in Molecular and Cell Biology and Data Science, as well as a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration. My research bridges the life sciences and business, aiming to leverage basic scientific advances to address diseases overlooked by traditional market incentives. I'm broadly interested in studying the molecular co-evolution between different organisms, natural systems discovery, and immunological aging.

My prior research focused on developing molecular tools and and investigating host-pathogen interactions. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WbQ0-o0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
